    <i>Note: The demos on the page will play spoken audio. Headphones are recommended.</i>
    <p>On the modern web, there are countless resources describing what to do and what not to do in order to make a
      website accessible. But sometimes these pieces of advice can feel confusing or incomplete without experiencing the
      problems they solve first-hand.</p>
    <p>The following demos aim to help bridge that initial information gap.</p>

          <p>Welcome! This demo will demonstrate the usage of a basic screen reader. The input keys are simplified for
            the purpose of the demo but many of the navigation principles are the same for a real tool like
            NVDA,
            JAWS, or VoiceOver. Press the down arrow to continue.</p>
          <p>If you'd like to adjust the speed of the voice, you can do so at any time using the comma key to decrease
            or period key to increase the speed.</p>
          <p>Right now you're navigating between blocks of content. In this case the blocks are text, but blocks can be
            many different pieces of the page including buttons, images, and forms. You can navigate to previous blocks
            using the up arrow or press the down arrow to continue.
          </p>
          <p>Chances are you can see the content of this demo, but many people who use screen readers cannot. Subsequent
            demos will
            default to having the page hidden, but you can always reveal it by pressing the button above or P on your
            keyboard. Press the down arrow to continue.</p>
          <p>This is the end of the intro demo. From now on, the demos will omit the explicit down arrow prompt. Press
            escape to exit the demo.</p>

          <p>This demo will show how different methods of handling images work. To start out with, below is an image
            with no alt text. Listen for what happens when you focus it.</p>
          <img
            src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1448375240586-882707db888b?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w2ODIxMTJ8MHwxfGFsbHx8fHx8fHx8fDE3MzMxMjQ4NjF8&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080"
            width="600">
          <p>That wasn't great, was it? With no alt text, the browser falls back on the file name of the image which in
            this case is just "photo" followed by a long string of numbers and letters. This is both distracting and
            uninformative.</p>
          <img
            src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1448375240586-882707db888b?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w2ODIxMTJ8MHwxfGFsbHx8fHx8fHx8fDE3MzMxMjQ4NjF8&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080"
            width="600" alt="">
          <p>You actually just missed an image. The previous image has an alt text sent to an empty string. This
            causes the screen reader to skip over it completely. This is useful if the image is purely decorative
            like a fancy background or icon. In this case, this is likely fine because the image <i>is</i> a decorative
            image of some trees.
          </p>
          <img src="/wifi-creds.png" width="600" alt="">
          <p>You just missed another image. But this time it had important content in it about hotel wifi credentials.
            Without a label there's no way of knowing what
            it says, and since the alt text is empty, we don't even know we're missing information. In this way, empty
            alt text should be used, but used carefully.
          </p>
          <img src="/wifi-creds.png" width="600"
            alt="Hotel Wifi credentials. The username is guest and the password is totally secure, all one word, all lowercase.">
          <p>This is much better, using fully specified alt text. It quickly communicates the essential contents of the
            image like the username and password, while also ignoring irrelevant
            info. For example it doesn't matter that the background of the image is purple. This is a good image / alt
            text pairing.

          <h1>Rotors: Quicker Navigation</h1>
          <p>You just focused over a heading. Having properly tagged headings can help experienced screen reader users
            quickly navigate the page.</p>
          <p>This is done through the use of a tool called a rotor. Screen readers typically have rotors for multiple
            different types of items like headers, links, text boxes, and more. Headings in particular are useful
            because they typically label larger sections and allow you to skip over large blocks of content. In this
            demo, you can use a header rotor with H to go to the next header and Shift H to go to the previous one. Jump
            to the next header now using H.</p>
          <p>This is the next text block. It should have been skipped by using the header rotor.</p>
          <h2>Section 2</h2>
          <p>This is a new section labelled by a new heading. For the next task, try finding information about what the
            next demo shows. There is lots of useless text, so try using the header rotor.</p>
          <p>This is some example useless text!</p>
          <p>More useless text!</p>
          <p>Even more useless text!</p>
          <h2>Unhelpful Section</h2>
          <p>This content is not helpful.</p>
          <h3>Unhelpful Subsection</h3>
          <p>Neither is this.</p>
          <p>Nor this.</p>
          <h2>Another Unhelpful Section</h2>
          <p>This content is not helpful.</p>
          <h3>Another Unhelpful Subsection</h3>
          <p>Neither is this.</p>
          <p>Nor this.</p>
          <h2>About the Next Demo</h2>
          <p>Nice, you found it! The next demo will explore how a link rotor can be used in a similar way.</p>
          <p>Along the way, you may have noticed different heading levels.
            These let you know how deep into subsections you are. A larger number means a deeper subsection and
            typically heading level one is used for a page title. This relies on website authors to setup correctly.
            It's a
            big help to screen reader users to know whether they're in a subsection or a main section, so getting these
            correct can make a site more navigable.</p>
          <p>This is the end of this demo. You can press escape to exit or P to show the page.</p>
          <h2>Have we Gone Too Far?</h2>
          <p>Yes probably, try using shift and h!</p>

          <h1>Link Rotors and Labelling</h1>
          <p>Welcome back. This time we're going to use a link rotor to find links in the page. To open a link, press
            space. To use the link rotor, press L to go to the next link and shift L to go to the previous link. The
            following block is a link.</p>
          <a href="https://example.com">example.com</a>
          <p>This link is labelled well. It can standalone and clearly communicates where it goes.</p>
          <p>It may not seem super important to have link labels standalone, until you realize that when navigating by
            rotor, you only hear the link text.</p>
          <p>The task for this demo is to find a link to the Web Speech API article on MDN amidst lots of other
            content and several other links. Use the heading rotor and then link rotor for this.</p>

          <p>That article happens to discuss the technology this page uses for text to speech. You may have noticed that
            some of the previous links were just labeled "here" or "link". The confusion resulting from missing
            surrounding context makes this less accessible than it could be.</p>

    <p>Hopefully these examples have been helpful to build some understanding about how screen readers work. If you've
      found these interesting, I'd recommend installing or activating your system screen reader to see the differences
      and
      how its used in more complex pages.</p>
